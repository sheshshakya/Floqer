# React + TypeScript + Vite

This project provides insights into the salaries of Machine Learning Engineers from 2020 to 2024. It includes a basic table displaying the number of total jobs and average salary in USD for each year. Users can sort the table by any column. Additionally, there are analytics features, including a line graph showing salary trends over the years and a secondary table that appears when a user clicks on a specific year, displaying aggregated job titles and the number of jobs for that year. Furthermore, there's a bonus feature implemented using OpenAI's LLMs, where users can interact with a chat app to get insights from the data beyond the graphs.
